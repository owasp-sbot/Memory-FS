# TODO Documentation

This directory records outstanding TODO items extracted from the code base.
The notes are divided by area so future development can focus on one file.

Files included here:
- [`core_todos.md`](core_todos.md) – tasks for the main API and data management classes.
- [`storage_providers.md`](storage_providers.md) – items related to the storage backends and helpers.
- [`tests.md`](tests.md) – TODO notes inside the unit tests.
