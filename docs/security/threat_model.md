# Threat Model for Memory-FS

This threat model was prepared using ChatGPT via Codex following the guidance from [Jim Manico's Threat Modeling Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-683a14e4b0488191b55072f3539f2834-threat-modeling-assistant).

## System Overview
Memory-FS is a Python library that implements a type-safe, in-memory file system. It exposes a `Memory_FS` facade composed of action classes for saving, loading, editing and querying files. All file content and metadata reside in memory inside `Memory_FS__File_System`.

## Context
- **Purpose**: Provide a fast and flexible storage layer for applications that only need temporary file persistence.
- **Architecture**: Modular action-based classes over an in-memory storage backend with pluggable path handlers and file types.
- **Users**: Developers embedding Memory-FS in their applications.
- **Data**: Arbitrary file content and associated metadata stored as dictionaries.
- **Integrations**: Future adapters may connect to S3, SQLite or local disk, but current implementation is memory only.

## Assets
- In-memory file data and metadata
- Configuration schemas, path handlers and file type definitions
- Public API for file operations

## Threat Actors
- Malicious consumers of the library
- Attackers providing custom path handlers or file type implementations
- Insiders misconfiguring the system

## Attack Vectors
- Untrusted input sent to Memory-FS APIs
- Execution of unreviewed path handler or file type code
- Excessive use of in-memory storage leading to resource exhaustion

## Misconfigurations
- Exposing Memory-FS APIs without authentication or authorization
- Allowing unsafe serialization formats (e.g., pickle)
- No limits on file size, count or overall memory usage

## Trust Boundaries
- Boundary between application code and untrusted user input
- Interaction with external storage backends when implemented
- Extension mechanisms for path handlers and file types

## Threats
| ID | Threat | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| T1 | Unauthorized Access | Untrusted callers could read or modify files when the API lacks proper access control. |
| T2 | Memory Exhaustion | Storing many or large files may exhaust memory and cause denial of service. |
| T3 | Path Manipulation | Malicious path handlers might overwrite existing files or escape expected namespaces. |
| T4 | Unsafe Serialization | Dangerous formats could lead to code execution when loading untrusted data. |
| T5 | Data Leakage | Debug logs or core dumps may expose sensitive in-memory data. |
| T6 | Volatility Assumptions | Crashes or restarts cause data loss that callers might not expect. |
| T7 | Malicious Extensions | File type or path handler plugins could run malicious code. |
| T8 | Concurrency Issues | Race conditions in multi-threaded use could corrupt data. |

## Risk Analysis
Threats are assessed with common-sense impact and likelihood:
- **High Impact**: T1, T2, T4
- **Medium Impact**: T3, T5, T6, T7, T8
Likelihood increases if Memory-FS is exposed to untrusted input or third-party extensions.

## Recommended Mitigations
- Enforce authentication and authorization around Memory-FS usage.
- Validate all input through type-safe models and restrict custom extensions.
- Use safe serialization formats (JSON, YAML safe loader) only.
- Configure limits for file sizes and total memory usage.
- Clearly document that data is volatile and implement persistence if needed.
- Review and test custom path handlers and file types before use.
- Avoid running untrusted code within the same trust boundary.

## Conclusion
Memory-FS offers speed and flexibility but relies entirely on volatile in-memory storage. By restricting access, validating input, controlling resources and scrutinizing extensions, the major threats identified above can be mitigated.
