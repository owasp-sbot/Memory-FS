# Memory-FS Technical Debriefs

This directory contains daily technical debriefs documenting the evolution of the Memory-FS project. These debriefs provide detailed insights into architectural decisions, implementation changes, and the rationale behind major refactoring efforts.

## Overview

Memory-FS is a type-safe, in-memory filesystem abstraction that provides a unified interface for storing and retrieving files. It serves as the reference implementation for a broader cloud filesystem abstraction that can work across multiple storage backends (S3, SQLite, local filesystem, etc.).

## Debrief Timeline

### [May 26, 2025 - Project Genesis](./on-26-may-2025.md)
- **Initial Design**: OSBot_Cloud_FS architectural planning
- **Core Concepts**: Type-safe storage abstraction, two-file pattern (metadata + content)
- **Key Decisions**: Memory-first architecture, pluggable path handlers, extensible file types
- **Status**: Design phase, establishing foundational patterns

### [May 27, 2025 - Standalone Extraction](./on-27-may-2025.md)
- **Major Milestone**: Extracted Memory-FS as standalone package
- **Published**: Released on PyPI as `memory-fs`
- **Architecture**: Refactored from monolithic to action-based classes
- **Key Innovation**: Decomposed storage operations into focused action classes

### [May 28, 2025 - Project Abstraction](./on-28-may-2025.md)
- **Paradigm Shift**: Moved from path handlers in files to project-level path strategies
- **New Features**: Introduced Memory_FS__Project and file-centric API
- **Simplification**: Direct path specification instead of handler-based generation
- **Convention**: Established `.fs.json` metadata file pattern

### [May 30, 2025 - Consolidation](./on-30-may-2025.md)
- **Refactoring**: Removed Memory_FS__Exists class, consolidated into Memory_FS__Data
- **Naming**: Renamed `file_name` to `file_id` throughout codebase
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced with `@type_safe` decorators
- **API Consistency**: All methods now use configuration objects

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Action-Based Architecture
The project uses a decomposed architecture where each operation type has its own focused class:
- `Memory_FS__Save`: Handles file saving and serialization
- `Memory_FS__Load`: Manages file loading and deserialization  
- `Memory_FS__Data`: Read-only data operations and queries
- `Memory_FS__Edit`: File manipulation (copy, move, delete)
- `Memory_FS__Paths`: Centralized path generation logic

### Type Safety
Every component leverages OSBot-Utils' Type_Safe base class for:
- Runtime parameter validation
- Consistent error handling
- Self-documenting code through type annotations

### Two-File Pattern
Each stored file consists of:
1. **Content File**: The actual file data in its native format
2. **Metadata File**: JSON file with `.fs.json` extension containing file metadata

### Project-Based Path Management
Path strategies are managed at the project level, allowing files to focus solely on storage concerns while projects handle path generation and organization strategies.

## Reading Order

For those new to the project, we recommend reading the debriefs in chronological order:

1. **May 26**: Understand the original vision and design principles
2. **May 27**: See how the monolithic design was decomposed into actions
3. **May 28**: Learn about the project abstraction and simplified path handling
4. **May 30**: Review the latest consolidations and API improvements

## Contributing

When adding new debriefs:
1. Use the naming convention: `on-DD-month-YYYY.md`
2. Include an Executive Summary that connects to previous work
3. Document both the "what" and the "why" of changes
4. Provide before/after code examples for major changes
5. Include a conclusion that looks forward to next steps

## Future Debriefs

Upcoming topics likely to be covered:
